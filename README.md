# üß† ParkinsonBiomech-XAI-GAN  
### *Uncovering Latent Biomechanical Signatures in Parkinson's Gait using Explainable AI and Synthetic Profiling*

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This flagship project aims to identify, explain, and simulate latent biomechanical phenotypes in Parkinson‚Äôs gait using clustering, generative models, and explainable AI. We move beyond classical classification by exploring hidden structures in movement patterns and creating a synthetic simulator to empower clinical research, training, and screening.

## üéØ Clinical and Scientific Objective

To **discover biomechanical phenotypes** in Parkinson's patients, **explain their key features**, and **generate realistic synthetic patient profiles** using ctGAN, with potential applications in:
- Clinical education
- Disease monitoring
- Hypothesis generation
- Anomaly detection in digital gait biomarkers
